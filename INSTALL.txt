Installation
------------

1. Copy the entire quiz/ folder into your modules directory.

2. Log in to your site as an administrator, and go to the Administer >> Site building >> Modules
   section. Enable both the Quiz module and at least one question type module 
   (for example, Multichoice).

   **NOTE: matching.module at this point is there only for testing purposes and 
   will not actually do anything. Please ignore it for now.**


Configuration
-------------

1. Create a vocabulary (or several) for classifying quiz questions, and 
   associate one or more question types with that vocabulary. These steps are 
   performed in Administer >> Content management >> Categories.

2. Create a user role with "create quiz" and "administer <question_type>"
   permissions. The role can be created under Administer >> User management >> Roles and the rights can be assigned to the role under Administer >> User management >> Access control.
   Assigning users to this role allows users other than the administrator to 
   create questions and quizzes.
   
3. Add the "access quiz" permission to roles under Administer >> User management >> Access control that should be allowed to take the quizzes.


How to create a quiz
--------------------

1. Begin by creating a series of questions that you would like to include in 
   the quiz. Go to Create content >> <question type> (for example, Multichoice).
   
2. Next, create a basic quiz by going to Create content >> Quiz. You will have 
   the opportunity to set numerous options such as the number of questions, 
   whether or not to shuffle question order, etc. When finished, click "Submit."
   
3. Finally, add questions to the quiz by clicking the "Add questions" tab. First,
   adjust the search criteria and click "Search" to bring up a list of matching
   questions. Once the list is created, select the options on how you want each 
   question to appear in the quiz. Finally, click "Submit" to complete the quiz 
   creation.


FAQ
---
Q. I'm getting tons of errors when I try and install this module! Why?
A. Make sure you've installed this module against Drupal 5.x. 

Q. What is matching.module for?
A. Right now, matching.module is only a placeholder for development, to test 
   certain functionality that might break when more than one question type is 
   found. For now, you can safely ignore this file.
